```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

```{r package}
library(tidyverse)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r read_data}
shots <- read_csv("nba_shots.csv")
shots <- shots %>% str_to_title(.$player_name)
shots <- shots %>% mutate_if(is.character, as.factor)
str(shots)
totals <- read_csv("totals_1415.csv")
into_names <- names(totals) %>% str_split(",") %>% .[[1]]
names(totals) <- "x"
totals <- totals %>% separate(x, into_names, sep = ",")
totals <- as_data_frame(totals)
head(totals)
positions <- totals %>% select(c("Player", "Pos"))
head(positions)
## now i need to do some checking of missing values and get a sense of what is going on with the data including
## some exploratory analysis and visualization but also want to get some kind of merge with the positions so 
## that the nearest defender length/size can be included
```

```{r explore_data}
nrow(positions)
n_distinct(positions)
positions <- positions %>% distinct(Player, .keep_all = TRUE)
sum(is.na(positions$Player))
positions <- positions %>% drop_na()
#positions[-which(is.na(positions$Player)), ]
##this was just a rdeference line of where the data came from in the totals df
```
