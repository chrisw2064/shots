Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r read_data}
shots <- read_csv("nba_shots.csv")
player_names <- map_chr(shots$player_name, str_to_title)
shots$player_name <- player_names
shots <- shots %>% mutate_if(is.character, as.factor)
str(shots)
shots_nested <- shots %>% group_by(GAME_ID) %>% nest()
totals <- read_csv("totals_1415.csv")
into_names <- names(totals) %>% str_split(",") %>% .[[1]]
names(totals) <- "x"
totals <- totals %>% separate(x, into_names, sep = ",")
totals <- as_data_frame(totals)
head(totals)
positions <- totals %>% select(c("Player", "Pos"))
head(positions)
## checking of missing values and get a sense of what is going on with the data including
## some exploratory analysis and visualization but also want to join with positions so 
## that the nearest defender length/size can be included
```

```{r explore_data}
nrow(positions)
n_distinct(positions)
positions <- positions %>% distinct(Player, .keep_all = TRUE)
sum(is.na(positions$Player))
positions[which(is.na(positions$Player)), ]
positions <- positions %>% drop_na()
##this was just a reference line of where the data came from in the totals df
```
